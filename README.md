# Data Cleaner

A straightforward Python tool to clean up messy CSV or Excel datasets â€” tailored for health and research data, but versatile enough for any tabular data.

This script tackles duplicates, missing values, inconsistent column names, and outliers to deliver analysis-ready data with a clear summary of whatâ€™s been done.

Built for researchers, analysts, and data enthusiasts who want clean data without the hassle.

## âœ… Features

- Removes **duplicate rows** to ensure data integrity
- Standardizes **column names** to `snake_case` (lowercase, underscores, no special characters)
- Handles **missing values** with flexible options:
  - Delete rows with missing data
  - Fill with zeros
  - Impute with **mean** (for numeric columns)
  - Impute with **mode** (for categorical columns)
  - Default to `"MISSING"` in other cases
- Detects and caps **outliers** in numeric columns using z-score (default threshold: `3`)
- Optimizes **column data types** for seamless use in analysis tools
- Exports cleaned data as a **UTF-8 encoded `.csv`** file
- Provides a **terminal cleaning summary**: duplicates removed, missing values handled, and more
